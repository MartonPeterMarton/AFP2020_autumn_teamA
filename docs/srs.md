# Software Requirements Specification

## Introduction

-Our team consists of four developers, who are eagerly helping out each other and solve problems together.
We want to create a device which makes an easier way for slides in the aquapark.
This device would be an identifier. The guests get this when they enter the aquapark, and have to use when they use a slide.
When they leave, they give back the identifier, and they get a detailed reciept about the slides.
If someone give the identifier back, another guests could use it. The usage of slides also
should be monitored because the management wants to check daily reports about the slides.


## Problems of current situation

- Many people have to stand beside the slide and supervise it.
-Time consuming
-Can't be monitored


## Vision

-The guests can use the slide more effectivly. The aquapark workers gets the full statistic, so their job will be easier.
At the end of the day each guest get a detailed reciept, where they find which slides and how many times did they use.


## Requirement list

-Every guest gets an identifier when enter the aquapark
-Every identifier should be unique


## Admin interface

-Get a massage when somebody enters or leaves
-Get a detailed statistic
